This is just a collection of code snippets I wrote to train my programming abilities and to lern a proper C++.

As sources I used following scripts and books:
http://www.cplusplus.com/files/tutorial.pdf
The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference (2nd Edition) by Nicolai M. Josuttis 

In general, http://www.cplusplus.com seems to be a great source for beginners!
